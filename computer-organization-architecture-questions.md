    A: Speculative execution is a technique where the processor executes instructions before knowing if they are actually needed, potentially improving performance by utilizing idle CPU resources.

27. Q: What is the purpose of the dirty bit in cache memory systems?
    A: The dirty bit indicates whether the data in a cache line has been modified and needs to be written back to main memory before being replaced.

28. Q: Describe the difference between SIMD and MIMD parallel processing architectures.
    A: SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) executes the same instruction on multiple data elements simultaneously, while MIMD (Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data) allows different processors to execute different instructions on different data.

    A: The store buffer holds pending store operations, allowing the processor to continue executing instructions without waiting for stores to complete, improving performance.

45. Q: What is the role of the decode unit in a CPU?
    A: The decode unit interprets fetched instructions, breaking them down into micro-operations that can be executed by the processor's functional units.

46. Q: Explain the concept of precise exceptions in pipelined processors.
    A: Precise exceptions ensure that when an exception occurs, the processor state accurately reflects the sequential execution of instructions up to the point of the exception, simplifying exception handling.

47. Q: What is the purpose of the reservation station in out-of-order execution processors?
    A: Reservation stations hold instructions and their operands, allowing them to be issued to execution units as soon as their operands are available and resources are free.

48. Q: Describe the difference between a blocking and non-blocking cache.
    A: A blocking cache stalls the processor on a cache miss until the data is fetched, while a non-blocking cache allows the processor to continue executing other instructions during a cache miss.
